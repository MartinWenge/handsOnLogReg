# Hands on Session on Logistic Regression from Scratch

Inspired by the following blogs, this is a simple hands on session to be used as an introduction to machine learning starting with logistig regression.

* [Github repo jupyter-notebook logreg from scratch](https://github.com/beckernick/logistic_regression_from_scratch/blob/master/logistic_regression_scratch.ipynb)

There are two jupyter notebooks provided in this repository: A hopefully self-explaining full presentation notebook and a almost blanck notebook to start with in the session.

The notebooks require [numpy](https://numpy.org/), matplotlib, sklearn and optionally tensorflow.

The simples way to use them on all platforms is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
